<h1> This is my first basic Apparel E-commerce Site <h1>
<p> The site was created using ReactJS with Redux <p>
<p> I used Redux for state management to communicate between different pages and for the sorting section <p>
<p> My biggest challenge in this project was using redux to sort the different arrays stored in the store and filtering and showing what the user is asking/looking for <p>
