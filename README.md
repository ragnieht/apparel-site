# This is my first basic Apparel E-commerce Site 

- The site was created using ReactJS with Redux 
- I used Redux for state management to communicate between different pages and for the sorting section 
- My biggest challenge in this project was using redux to sort the different arrays stored in the store and filtering and showing what the user is asking/looking for
